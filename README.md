# Edicare

Edicare is a web application designed for administering building amenities. It provides a user-friendly interface for owners, renters, building administrators, and super admins to manage various aspects of a building.

This project was developed as a requirement for the "Programacion Web" subject at Universidad Catolica Argentina. As part of the project guidelines, we were not allowed to use any type of frameworks, which made it a challenging learning experience in web development.

## Features

- Multiple User Roles: Edicare supports three separate login roles - owners/renters, building administrators, and super admin.
- Building Administration: Building administrators can manage building details, common rooms, facilities, and amenities.
- Booking System: Users can book common rooms, facilities, and amenities based on availability.
- User Management: Super admins have the ability to create and manage users, assign roles, and oversee multiple buildings.
- Easy-to-Use Interface: The application offers a simple and intuitive user interface for smooth navigation and interaction.
